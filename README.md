Unity Sandbox

This Project uses Scriptable Objects to define Assets that can be spawned at Runtime by the player.  

There are Editor Script available to help you generate spawnable items automatically by selecting a target folder.  

The items can be spawned using a Spawner at the position the Spawner is pointing.
